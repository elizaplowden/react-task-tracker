My first React project following a Brad Traversy YouTube tutorial. 
This was my first time using hooks and function based components such as useState.
It is a React task manager built from a Create React App template, which uses a JSON server backend to mimic a REST API.
I look forward to developing my skills further by creating a React application with a real backend.

To run the app in development mode:
yarn start
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
